Using a static partial equilibrium setting, both in a steady state and steady growth scenario, we derive a bank-specific valuation metric which separately attributes value to assets and debt cash flows in the form of a liquidity premium and tax-shield. We run our model on a sample of the largest 26 European banks from 2003 to 2016 finding that the value contribution of debt benefits to enterprise value is large and persistent. Further from our model, we derived an implied cost of capital (ICC) measure finding consistent results with capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The theoretical framework we present is helpful to address bank debt benefits valuation and to reconcile equity and asset side approaches.</p>},

New growth theories have especially focused on the effects of institutions and institutional structure on a macro level. Property rights are one of the most important elements of this institutional structure. The relationship between property rights and economic growth have drawn the attention of many researchers and policymakers in recent years. The aim of this study, covering the period 2007–2014, is to examine the relationship between property rights and economic growth with the help of PARDL in OECD and EU countries. According to the result of a bounds test, there is cointegration between the variables. The long- and short-term relationships between series were determined and the results taken from the analysis show that there is a positive effect on economic growth in those countries.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Banks are financial intermediaries who transform deposits into loans. Banks in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region use large deposits from oil companies and big businesses to finance trade, and fund government and private sector infrastructure projects. The role of banks in financing trade and development is significant as undeveloped capital markets are unable to perform this function. During the COVID-19 crisis, banks sustained liquidity shocks, as deposits were withdrawn to meet personal and business needs. Essentially, banks could not make loans, as the funds to make loans were depleted. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of liquidity creation as a main force, in conjunction with other performance predictors such as efficient asset management, asset quality, and bank size, on bank financial performance, either individually or in conjunction with liquidity creation during the COVID-19 financial crisis. We used bank financial data from a sample of 298 banks from 11 countries in the MENA region, including Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Israel, from 2020 to2021. Liquidity creation, efficient asset management, asset quality, and bank size increased bank return on assets and return on equity. Bank size and asset quality acted jointly with liquidity creation to increase return on assets and increase return on equity. We conclude that as liquidity creation acts individually, and in conjunction with asset quality and bank size to increase bank profits, both its main effect and its moderated effect, can maintain bank profitability, during periods of extreme liquidity supply shocks, such as the COVID-19 crisis.</p>},

The study has used parametric techniques like multiple linear regression and correlation coefficient, and other statistical methods to investigate its hypothesis. It was found that only human capital efficiency and capital employed efficiency had impacts on the banks’ financial performance. These results emphasize the importance of using the VAIC model to evaluate the financial performance of these banks, as well as encourage banks to make further investments in intellectual capital’s components, and concentrate on human resources to build up their knowledge, skills and capabilities, because of their greatest role in value creation.</p>},

We find that high ESG scores are associated with a modest reduction in risk‐taking for banks that are high or low risk‐takers, and that the impact is conditional on executive board characteristics. These findings are consistent with the “stakeholder” view of ESG activities. However, high ESG scores are also associated with a reduction in bank value consistent with the “overinvestment” view of ESG whereby scare resources are diverted from investment. The decline in bank value occurs notwithstanding a positive indirect link between ESG scores and bank value through their impact on risk taking. We conclude that there is a trade‐off between reducing bank risk‐taking and a more stable financial system on the one hand and bank value on the other.</p>},

The results also show that environmental performance and social performance are significantly positively related to economic sustainable performance, indicating that the corporation’s economic value and creating value for society are interdependent.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most Korean firms suffered unexpected difficulties in their business activities in early 2020, and their financial performance deteriorated significantly. The purpose of this study is to empirically analyze whether a firm’s ESG activities affect its financial performance during a business crisis. The results show that, in the first quarter of 2020, when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, firms’ earnings dropped significantly; however, we found that the higher the performance of ESG activities, the smaller the decline in earnings. The results imply that, in an environment of uncertainty, the performance of a firm’s ESG activities is reflected in its financial outcomes. This result implies that trust and bond between firms and stakeholders, as formed through investments in social capital, are rewarded when the overall level of sustainability in markets is negatively impacted. In addition, our results suggest that the performance of nonfinancial activities is useful information for stakeholders’ decision making in relation to market uncertainty.</p>},

Based on data collected from 220 banks in 16 Sub‐Saharan Africa countries over the 2007–2018 period (i.e., making over 2027 bank‐year observations), the findings of the study are as follows: Firstly, the study finds that corporate governance mechanisms have positive impact on sustainable decisions, as captured by environmental disclosures and sustainable banking initiatives. Secondly, the study finds that sustainable banking initiatives improve the financial performance of banks in the Sub‐Saharan African countries. Finally, the study detects that the relationship between sustainable banking initiatives and financial performance is significantly moderated by corporate governance mechanisms, revealing that the sustainability‐for‐performance sensitivity metric is mainly positive, and improves in banks with quality corporate governance mechanisms. This indicates that the sustainability‐for‐performance sensitivity is contingent on the quality of the bank's corporate governance structures.

   abstract = {<p>Every sector of the global economy is faced with environmental problems and their resulting consequences to their day-to-day operations. Due to the rising threat of global climate change, the green banking (GB) concept has been given significant attention in recent green finance literature. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to identify the impact of GB practices on banks’ environmental performance and sources of green financing of private commercial banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh. Using a survey method, the primary data were obtained from a cross-sectional sample of 322 banking employees of PCBs in Bangladesh. In order to identify the key relationships existing between the study variables, structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was employed. The empirical findings indicated that banks’ employees, daily-operations, and policy-related GB practices have significant positive effects on green financing, contrary to banks’ customer-related GB practice, which was not statistically significant. Additionally, banks’ green project financing exhibited a strong and positive influence on banks’ environmental performance. Moreover, banks’ daily operation and policy-related practices of GB were observed to have significant impacts on banks’ environmental performances, in contrast to banks’ employee and customer-related GB practices. Therefore, major policy implications and directions for future research in the concerned area are discussed.</p>},

   abstract = {The financial crisis that began in 2007 was triggered by over-leveraged homeowners and a severe downturn in US housing markets. However, a reasonably well-supervised financial system would have been much more resilient to this and other types of severe shocks. Instead, the core of the financial system became a key channel of propagation and magnification of losses suffered in the housing market. Critical financial intermediaries failed, or were bailed out, or dramatically reduced their provision of liquidity and credit to the economy. In short, the core financial system ceased to perform its intended functions for the real economy at a reasonable level of effectiveness. As a result, the impact of the housing-market shock on the rest of the economy was much larger than necessary. In this essay, I will review the key sources of fragility in the core financial system. I discuss the weakly supervised balance sheets of the largest banks and investment banks; the run-prone designs and weak regulation of the markets for securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives; the undue reliance of regulators on “market discipline; and the interplay of too-big-to-fail and the failure of market discipline. Finally, I point to some significant positive strides that have been made since the crisis: improvements in the capitalization of the largest financial institutions, a reduction of unsafe practices and infrastructure in the markets for securities financing and derivatives, and a significantly reduced presumption that the largest financial firms will be bailed out by taxpayer money in the future. But I will also mention some remaining challenges to financial stability that could be addressed with better regulation and market infrastructure.},

   abstract = {Previous empirical evidence provides mixed results on the relationship between corporate environmental performance and the level of environmental disclosures. We revisit this relation by testing competing predictions from economics based and socio-political theories of voluntary disclosure using a more rigorous research design. In particular, we improve on the prior literature by focusing on purely discretionary environmental disclosures and by developing a content analysis index based on the Global Reporting Initiative sustainability reporting guidelines to assess the extent of discretionary disclosures in environmental and social responsibility reports. This index better captures firm disclosures related to its commitment to protect the environment than the indices employed by prior studies. Using a sample of 191 firms from the five most polluting industries in the US, we find a positive association between environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclosures. The result is consistent with the predictions of the economics disclosure theory but inconsistent with the negative association predicted by socio-political theories. Nevertheless, we show that socio-political theories explain patterns in the data ("legitimization") that cannot be explained by economics disclosure theories. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of an absence of environmental reporting standards, however, these reports differ significantly thereby confounding comparability. Additionally, the credibility of these reports is being questioned, as they are typically not verified by independent third parties. As many public accounting firms are currently attempting to develop additional assurance services to offer existing and potential clients, verification of environmental reports may be an appropriate application of accounting firms' attestation skills and their desire to expand the client relationship. Such verification engagements may also be beneficial for corporations, investors, regulators and, ultimately, the environment. Guidance and criteria for environmental verification services are scant, however, and the accounting profession may benefit from expeditious development of such standards so that public accountants are empowered to offer a needed assurance service and compete effectively with other consulting firms.</p>},

   abstract = {This exploratory study examines the relations between corporate social and environmental reporting (CSR)1 and the socially responsible investment (SRI)2 sector. The evidence presented, based upon the informed opinions of 14 experts within the SRI field, suggests that the field of CSR is on the verge of a major change towards a substantial and sustained improvement in quality and quantity. The SRI sector is undergoing radical changes. A wider social movement has already led to exponential growth, as more people become concerned with how their money is invested. Moreover, the Pensions Review has widened this concern to institutional investment. Representing 35% of the stock market, the potential impact of this regulation is anticipated to be significant. One possible outcome could be a marked increase in the size and power of the SRI sector, improving their ability to successfully influence corporate behaviour. Success is likely to increase further as corporations begin to see a business case, as well as, or as opposed to a moral case, for acting in a more responsible manner. The Turnbull report on the combined codes of corporate governance is a significant factor influencing this. For the first time, reputational risk, and hence how companies manage environmental, ethical and social reputations, is on the core corporate governance agenda. A more powerful outcome would be an increased interest from mainstream fund managers in SRI modes of corporate assessment. Preliminary evidence suggests that this will create a greater demand for CSR, and greater legitimacy of CSR within the accounting orthodoxy. © 2001 Academic Press.},

Our measure of environmental reporting comprises only information that is voluntarily disclosed by firms and which meaning implies specific initiatives or events. To assess how country-specific contexts may affect the impact of environmental reporting, we focus on firms from Canada, France and Germany; three countries that employ different reporting and governance regimes. Our design relies on simultaneous equations to control for the endogeneity between environmental reporting and firm attributes such as size, age of assets, industry membership and public media exposure. Results suggest that decisions to report environmental information have a moderating impact on the stock market valuation of a German firm's earnings. In contrast, environmental reporting does not significantly influence the stock market valuation of Canadian and French firms earnings. Overall, results indicate that in assessing how information released by a firm affects the stock market valuation of its earnings, it is important to control for the endogeneity between a firm's decision to disclose information, its exposure to media and its stock market value. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
