## Files Description

### 1. `Dissertation.R`
- **Purpose:** This is the main R script that orchestrates the data processing, analysis, and visualization for the dissertation. It brings together the data from different sources, performs the regression analysis, and generates the results presented in the study.

### 2. `CAPM.R`
- **Purpose:** R script dedicated to running the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) analysis. It uses the daily stock returns from `StockReturns.csv` and the Fama-French factors from `FFDaily.CSV` to estimate idiosyncratic and market risks for each bank.

### 3. `FFDaily.CSV`
- **Purpose:** Contains the daily Fama-French three-factor data, which is used in conjunction with bank stock returns to calculate idiosyncratic and market risks. These factors are essential for adjusting returns in the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) analysis.

### 4. `FSBanks.xlsx`
- **Purpose:** An Excel file containing the fundamental financial data and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores for the banks included in the study. This dataset provides the basis for analyzing how ESG factors influence financial performance.

### 5. `StockReturns.csv`
- **Purpose:** This file contains the daily stock returns of the banks under study. It is used in the CAPM analysis to calculate both idiosyncratic and market risks.

### 6. `capm_results.csv`
- **Purpose:** The output file generated by `CAPM.R`, containing the calculated idiosyncratic and market risks for the banks. These results are then used in the broader analysis presented in the dissertation.
